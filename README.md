# ILP: a media metadata scraper

> ILP is the abbreviation "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" (The name of a character in the novel [とある魔術の禁書目録](toaru-project.com)).

ILP is a media metadata scraper that I created for my personal use. I just don't want to deploy so many services for my media collection. So I want to use this tool to scrape all the metadata I need.
